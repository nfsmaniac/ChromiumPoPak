### Batch conversion
Call `batch-unpack.py` with _in_dir_ as input folder containing multiple PAK files and _out_dir_ as output folder where PO files will be saved. You don't need to create the output directory first. Also if you leave there some PO file, the script will make a backup first. Example: `python batch-unpack.py Locales converted`
